# Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issues & Solutions

### ✅ **FIXED: Room status updates now auto-create housekeeping tasks**

When you change a room status to "Cleaning" or "Maintenance", it now automatically creates a housekeeping task that appears in the Housekeeping Dashboard.

---

### 🔄 **Issue 1: Room card colors not updating immediately**

**Problem**: After changing a room status, the room card stays green and the status text disappears.

**Root Cause**: The page is waiting for the 5-second polling interval to refresh the data.

**Solution**: Hard refresh the page after updating, or wait 5 seconds for auto-refresh.

**Temporary Workaround**:
1. After clicking "Update Status", wait 5 seconds
2. The room cards will automatically update with the correct colors
3. OR press **Ctrl + Shift + R** to force refresh

**Permanent Fix (Optional)**:
We can add an immediate refresh after status update. Would you like me to implement this?

### ✅ **Issue 2: Tasks not appearing in Housekeeping Dashboard**

**Status**: NOW FIXED!

**What Changed**:
- When you set a room to "Cleaning" → Automatically creates a cleaning task
- When you set a room to "Maintenance" → Automatically creates a maintenance task (high priority)
- Tasks appear in the Housekeeping Dashboard within 5 seconds
- Prevents duplicate tasks for the same room

**Test It**:
1. Go to **Rooms Overview**
2. Click any vacant room
3. Change status to **"Cleaning"**
4. Click **"Update Status"**
5. Wait 5-10 seconds (or refresh)
6. Go to **Housekeeping Dashboard**
7. ✅ You should see the task in "Pending Tasks"

## 🎨 **Understanding Room Status Colors**

| Status | Color | What It Means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Vacant** | 🟢 Green | Room is clean and ready for guests |
| **Occupied** | 🔴 Red | Guest is currently in the room |
| **Cleaning** | 🟠 Orange | Housekeeping is cleaning the room |
| **Maintenance** | ⚫ Gray | Room needs repairs or maintenance |
| **Reserved** | 🔵 Blue | Room is booked for future guest |

## 🔄 **Data Sync Timeline**

**Automatic Refresh**: Every 5 seconds  
**Manual Refresh**: Ctrl + Shift + R  
**After Action**: Wait 5-10 seconds to see changes

### How Sync Works:
1. You update room status → Saved to database
2. Background polling (every 5 seconds) → Checks for updates
3. If changes found → Updates display
4. All connected pages → See the same data

- **Fix**: 
  1. Go to Housekeeping Dashboard
