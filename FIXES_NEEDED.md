## ❌ **Issues to Fix:**

### 1. Room Numbers Showing "null"
**Problem:** Room cards show "null" instead of room numbers (101, 102, etc.)

**Cause:** The `room_number` column in database has NULL values

**Fix:** Run `database/02_fix_room_numbers.sql`

**Steps:**
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select `inn_nexus` database
3. Go to SQL tab
4. Copy/paste content from `database/02_fix_room_numbers.sql`
5. Click "Go"
6. Refresh Rooms Overview page

---

### 2. Housekeeping Tasks Missing Room Numbers
**Problem:** Some tasks show "Room" instead of "Room 101"

**Cause:** Same as #1 - NULL room_number values

**Fix:** Same SQL script will fix this

---

### 3. Status Capitalization Inconsistency
**Problem:** Database has lowercase statuses (occupied, maintenance) but display expects capitalized (Occupied, Maintenance)

**Status:** Partially fixed - code now handles both, but database should be standardized

**Fix:** The SQL script will capitalize all statuses

---

## 🎯 **Priority Fixes:**

### High Priority:
1. ✅ **Fix room numbers** - Run `02_fix_room_numbers.sql`
2. ⏳ **Test room status updates** - Click a room, change status, verify it updates
3. ⏳ **Test housekeeping workflow** - Start a task, complete it, verify room updates

### Medium Priority:
4. ⏳ **Add more sample data** - More rooms on Floor 2 and 3
5. ⏳ **Test real-time sync** - Open both pages side-by-side, make changes
6. ⏳ **Verify toast notifications** - Check if success/error messages appear

### Low Priority:
7. ⏳ **UI polish** - Adjust colors, spacing, fonts
8. ⏳ **Add loading states** - Show spinners while fetching data
9. ⏳ **Error handling** - Better error messages for users

- [ ] Task moves to "In Progress"
- [ ] Click "Mark Complete"
- [ ] Task moves to "Completed"
- [ ] Wait 5 seconds

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### Immediate (Do Now):
1. **Run the SQL fix:** `database/02_fix_room_numbers.sql`
2. **Refresh both pages** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. **Verify room numbers appear**
4. **Test clicking a room** to open modal

### Short Term (Today):
5. **Test status updates** - Change a room status
6. **Test housekeeping workflow** - Complete a task
7. **Verify real-time sync** - Open both pages side-by-side

### Medium Term (This Week):
8. **Add more sample rooms** - Populate Floor 2 and 3
9. **Test with multiple users** - Have workmates test it
10. **Document any bugs** found during testing

## 🐛 **Known Issues:**

### Minor Issues:
- ⚠️ Room numbers showing "null" (Fix: Run SQL script)
- ⚠️ Some tasks missing room numbers (Fix: Same SQL script)
- ⚠️ Status capitalization inconsistent (Fix: Same SQL script)

### Not Issues (Working as Designed):
- ✅ All rooms showing on Floor 1 - This is correct, you have 13 rooms on Floor 1
- ✅ Different colors - This is correct based on status
- ✅ Housekeeping showing maintenance tasks - This is correct

---

## 💡 **Recommendations:**

### For Better Testing:
1. **Add variety to sample data:**
   - More vacant rooms
   - Some rooms with guest names
   - Different room types per floor

2. **Create realistic scenarios:**
   - Guest checks out → Room becomes "Cleaning"
   - Housekeeping completes → Room becomes "Vacant"
   - Maintenance issue → Room becomes "Maintenance"

3. **Test edge cases:**
   - What happens with no tasks?
   - What happens with 100+ rooms?
   - What happens if API is slow?

## 📞 **Need Help?**

### If room numbers still show "null":
1. Check if SQL script ran successfully
2. Verify: `SELECT room_number FROM rooms;` in phpMyAdmin
3. Check browser console for API errors

### If real-time sync not working:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Hotel Data Sync initialized"
3. Check Network tab for API calls every 5 seconds
4. Verify no 404 errors on `/api/rooms` or `/api/housekeeping`

### If colors are wrong:
1. Check room status in database: `SELECT room_number, status FROM rooms;`
2. Verify status is capitalized (Occupied, not occupied)
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
